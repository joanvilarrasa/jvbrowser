# jvbrowser
This is a simple browser application written in python following the guide in the Web Browser Engineering book.

## Chapter 5 note

Up until this chapter I have implemented the funcionality of described in each chapter and also the functionalily of the exercises at the end. My goal for this project is to gain a first, oversimplified overview of browser engineering so that I can participate easier to the ladybird browser iniciative.

I am realizing that doing all the extra exercises is costing me a lot of time, and it makes the book more confusing without adding that much value of information to be gained. Basically I am putting effort into something couterproductive.

From now on I will simplify the existing code when possible, and will not implement the exercises at the end of the chapters. If I find one particularly interesting I will do it in a branch. This will hopefully allow me to move faster with the project.
